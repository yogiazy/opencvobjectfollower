# Opencv Object Follower
A robot object follower using OpenCV and Python is a system that utilizes computer vision technology to detect an object's color and position in real-time. This system is designed to track and follow an object as it moves within a designated area.

To accomplish this, the system first captures a video stream using a camera mounted on the robot. It then applies image processing algorithms to identify the color of the object based on its hue, saturation, and value (HSV) values.

Once the object color has been identified, the system uses blob detection to determine the position of the object within the image. By calculating the centroid of the object, the system can determine its position relative to the robot's current location.

The robot then uses this information to adjust its movement and follow the object as it moves within the camera's field of view. The system continuously updates the object's position and adjusts the robot's movement accordingly to ensure that it stays on track.

Overall, a robot object follower using OpenCV and Python is a powerful tool that can be used for a wide range of applications, from manufacturing and logistics to surveillance and security. It offers precise and reliable object tracking, which can significantly improve operational efficiency and productivity.
